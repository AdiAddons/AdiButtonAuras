h1. AdiButtonAuras

Display auras on action buttons.

AdiButtonAuras is a rewrite of Inline Aura, but different design decisions based on my experience with
Inline Aura.

h2. Features

h3. Separate button overlays

A separate button overlay is created for each button, with border texture, texts and glowing animation.

Pro: Avoid tainting the action buttons, thus causing ADDON_BLOCKED errors. There is also no need
to hook various methods to re-apply the state after the stock UI modified them.

Con: this is not compatible with Masque or third-party action buttons.

h3. Hard-coded rules

The rules are hard-coded using a pretty simple "Domain Specific Language":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_specific_language
built on top of Lua.

Each rules specifies the spells to modify, the units and events to watch and one or more handlers.
Several rules about the same spell are merged together, or thrown if the character doesn't know the spell.

Each time one of the event is triggered for one of the unit, the handlers are called to update the
state of the associated button.

A set of convenient functions are provided to easily configure most spells. If a more specific task
is needed, Lua can be used (see interrupt spells).

Pro: far more powerful than the Inline Aura engine. This allows to show data from one unit merged with
the stat of another one, if need be.

Con: there is no way to configure this using a GUI.

h3. No auto-discovery

AdiButtonAuras only shows data for existing rules. It does not try to guess what to show.

Pro: avoid showing wrong data.

Con: all spells for all class should be listed.

h3. Using spell ids instead of spell names

AdiButtonAuras uses the spell numerical identifiers, instead of its name, to search for the applicable rules.

Pro: avoid showing information on a wrong spell that as the same name as the intended one.

Con: spells ids are sometimes different depending on shapeshift forms, glyphs or talents. All of them
should be listed.
